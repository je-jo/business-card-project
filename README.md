## Overview

### Description

This is a conversion of Adobe XD design to HTML and my first SASS project.

Project requirements:

- [x] The website looks similar to the design (Desktop and Mobile) and is available for users through a link.
- [x] Icons should be clickable and redirect users to external pages in a new tab.

Additional requirements:

- [x] Users can click on the email and the email client will open.
- [x] Users can click on phone and it'll start the call (on a mobile device).
- [] Best to introduce icons next to text for the above.
- [] Introduce e.g. Fade In animation.
