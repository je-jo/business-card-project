## Overview

### Description

This is a conversion of Adobe XD design to HTML and my first SASS project.

Project requirements:

- [x] The website looks similar to the design (Desktop and Mobile) and is available for users through a link.
- [x] Icons should be clickable and redirect users to external pages in a new tab.

Additional requirements:

- [x] Users can click on the email and the email client will open.
- [x] Users can click on phone and it'll start the call (on a mobile device).
- [ ] Best to introduce icons next to text for the above. (Skipped out on this, design would become cluttered.)
- [x] Introduce e.g. Fade In animation.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Observations

This deceptively simple page has some unique layout challenges. I especially liked the footer that goes from horizontal on small screens to vertical on large screens. 
This was supposed to be a project to practice SASS, but I also took time to look into web performance, inspired by [this great writeup](https://github.com/achaverrar/frontend-mentor-challenges/blob/main/product-preview-card-component/README.md) of a front-end process by [@achaverrar](https://github.com/achaverrar).
